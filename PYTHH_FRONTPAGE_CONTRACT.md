> "Paste your startup. We will show you who recognizes you."

**Not:**
> "Here's a product you should learn about."

---

## SECTION 8 — THE OVERRIDING RULE

**If a change:**
- Weakens the CTA
- Adds explanation
- Adds onboarding
- Adds marketing copy
- Adds SaaS layout tropes
- Adds product narration
- Reduces curiosity
- Increases clarity before intrigue

**It does not ship. No exceptions.**

---

## THE ONE-SENTENCE LOCK

> **The front page exists to make founders paste their URL. Not to understand Pythh.**

Everything else is noise.

---

## Version History

| Version | Date | Changes |
|---------|------|---------|
| 1.0 | Jan 20, 2026 | Initial frozen contract |

---

**This contract freezes the correct direction.**

No more hero thrash. No more SaaS gravity. No more "helpful" UI.
