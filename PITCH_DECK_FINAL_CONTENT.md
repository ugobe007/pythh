**Category**: Timing Intelligence for Capital Formation  
**Stage**: Post-engine, post-magic moment, pre-scale  
**Valuation Range**: $8M-$15M pre-money

## Slide 1: TITLE

### Content
```
Pyth
Timing Intelligence for Capital Formation

Detect capital convergence before outreach happens.
```

### Footer
- Founder name
- Contact email
- **[Loom 1 link embedded at top]**

### Design Notes
- Clean, minimal
- Loom thumbnail prominent
- Category line as subtitle (critical)

---

## Slide 2: PROBLEM

### Title
```
Fundraising is Not a Matching Problem.
It's a Timing Problem.
```

### Content
**Founders don't know**:
- If investors are discovering them
- If momentum is forming
- When they are entering an outreach window

**Investors don't know**:
- Where momentum is forming early
- Which startups are entering inflection

**Result**: Timing is invisible.

### Design Notes
- Split left/right (founders | investors)
- Red highlight on "Timing is invisible"

---

## Slide 3: WHY TOOLS FAIL

### Title
```
Existing Tools Show History, Not Movement
```

### Content
**They show**:
- Profiles
- Connections
- History

**They do NOT show**:
- Behavior
- Acceleration
- Convergence
- Timing

**Bottom line**: Capital movement is invisible today.

### Design Notes
- Two-column comparison
- X marks on left, checkmarks on right (what Pyth shows)

---

## Slide 4: INSIGHT

### Title
```
Capital Moves in Detectable Patterns
```

### Content
**Discovery behavior leaves traces**:
- Browsing similar startups
- Portfolio adjacency
- Forum and news activity
- Acceleration over time

**These signals appear before outreach.**

If you detect them early, you can time fundraising.

### Design Notes
- Visual diagram: Discovery Event → Signal → Convergence
- Physics metaphor visual (flow lines)

---

## Slide 5: PRODUCT (FOUNDER VIEW)

### Title
```
Capital Navigation for Founders
```

### Content
**Paste your best triad screenshot here.**

**Caption**:
Founders paste their URL and instantly see:
- How many investors are observing them
- Their capital flow state (watch → breakout)
- 5 investors converging now
- 184 more behind unlock
- Evidence per investor
- Forecast + coaching

**Bottom line**: Founders finally know: "Am I investable yet?"

### Design Notes
- Large screenshot
- Callouts highlighting: Position, Flow, Trajectory badges

---

## Slide 6: PROOF (KILLER SLIDE)

### Title
```
Live Behavioral Signals (Not Simulations)
```

### Content
**Real numbers from production system**:
- **1,129** real discovery events tracked
- **35** observers in last 7 days
- Startup in **breakout** state
- **184** investors in convergence pool
- Evidence bullets from **24h** acceleration
- **Median signal age: 6 hours** ← NEW

**Caption**: All signals derived from live behavioral events before outreach happens.

### Design Notes
- Bold numbers
- Green checkmarks
- "6 hours" highlighted (freshness signal)
- This slide alone gets meetings

## Slide 7: HOW IT WORKS

### Title
```
Behavioral Physics Pipeline
```

### Content
**Pipeline diagram**:
```
Scrapers + Discovery Logs
    ↓
Observer Tracking (core moat)
    ↓
Weighted Signals
    ↓
FOMO Acceleration
    ↓
Phase Change Detection
    ↓
Portfolio Adjacency

Convergence Ranking + Forecast
```

**Footer**: We rank intent, not profiles.

### Design Notes
- Vertical flow diagram
- "Observer Tracking" highlighted as moat
- Arrow style = flow physics

---

## Slide 8: MOAT

### Title
```
Observer Tracking Compounds
```

### Content
**The flywheel**:
- More founders → more discovery events
- More events → better timing signals
- Better signals → more founders

**Timing intelligence becomes increasingly defensible.**

**In 12 months, no one else will have this data.**

**NEW**: Timing models require longitudinal behavioral history — which cannot be backfilled.

### Design Notes
- Circular flywheel diagram
- "Cannot be backfilled" in red box
- Growth projection: 1,129 → 50K → 500K events

---

## Slide 9: PLATFORM FUTURE

### Title
```
Capital Market Intelligence Infrastructure
```

### Content
**Product roadmap**:
1. Founder Intelligence (live)
2. Investor Observatory (seed)
3. Capital Heatmaps (Series A)
4. Forecasting (Series A+)
5. Market Intelligence API (Series B+)
6. **Institutional Sourcing Radar** ← NEW

**Long-term**: Capital market intelligence infrastructure

### Design Notes
- Timeline or staircase visual
- "Institutional Sourcing Radar" hints at hedge funds, LPs
- Platform arc visible

---

## Slide 10: ASK

### Title
```
Raising: $1.5M–$3M Seed
Valuation: $8M–$15M pre-money
```

### Content
**Use of funds**:
- Scale data collection (50K events/month)
- Wire scrapers to observer tracking
- Build forecasting engine
- Launch investor observatory

**Stage positioning**:
> "We're post-engine, post-physics, pre-scale. The core system is live and validated — now we're scaling data density and distribution."

**Closing line** (your category anchor):
> "We don't match founders to investors — we detect when capital is converging on them."

### Design Notes
- Clean, confident
- Stage language prominent
- Closing line as footer
- Contact info

## Slide Sequence Strategy

### During Meeting
1. **Play Loom 1 first** (minutes 2-7)
2. **Then show deck** (minutes 7-15)
3. **Ask strategic question**: "From your perspective, where does timing intelligence become most valuable — founders, funds, or the market itself?"

### Email Sequence
1. **First email**: Loom 1 only, no deck
2. **Follow-up**: "If helpful, here's the deck" (send after reply)
3. **Never**: Send deck cold without Loom

## Key Slide Additions (vs Original)

### Slide 6: Added
- "Median signal age: 6 hours" (freshness signal)

### Slide 8: Added
- "Timing models require longitudinal behavioral history — which cannot be backfilled" (irreversibility)

### Slide 9: Added
- "Institutional Sourcing Radar" (hints at hedge fund/LP scale)

### Slide 10: Added
- Stage positioning quote ("post-engine, post-physics, pre-scale")

## Objection Handling (Meeting Prep)

### Q1: "How do you get the data?"
> "We observe real discovery behavior — portfolio pages, news mentions, forum discussions, search patterns. Every investor interaction leaves a trace. We're already tracking 1,129 events across 500+ investors and growing weekly. The value is in aggregation and timing models, not raw data."

### Q2: "Is this scraping risk?"
> "We don't depend on any single source. We aggregate across multiple public and semi-public discovery surfaces. The moat is aggregation and timing intelligence."

### Q3: "How accurate is the forecast?"
> "We don't predict investment outcomes. We predict outreach readiness and convergence probability — which is verifiable. As observer density increases, timing accuracy improves."

### Q4: "What stops someone from copying this?"
> "Observer tracking compounds. The data advantage grows with every discovery event. In 12 months, no one else will have this behavioral history — and timing models require longitudinal data that cannot be backfilled."

### Q5: "Is this a founder tool or investor tool?"
> "Founder first, investor second. Founders generate content and signals. Investors become sensors. Long-term, this becomes capital market intelligence infrastructure."

## What This Deck Achieves

### Psychological Journey
1. **Slide 2**: Founder pain (I'm lost)
2. **Slide 4**: Insight (Capital has physics)
3. **Slide 5**: Magic (I can see it now)
4. **Slide 6**: Proof (It's real)
5. **Slide 8**: Moat (No one can copy)
6. **Slide 9**: Vision (Platform scale)
7. **Slide 10**: Ask (Ready to close)

### Category Anchors
- Slide 1: "Timing Intelligence for Capital Formation"
- Slide 4: "Capital moves in detectable patterns"
- Slide 8: "Cannot be backfilled"
- Slide 10: "We detect when capital is converging"

These phrases will spread. You're defining the category.

## After First 10 Meetings

Track:
- **Which slide gets most questions** (usually Slide 6 or 8)
- **Which objection comes up most** (usually "data sourcing")
- **Which investors get excited immediately** (those who understand compounding)
- **Which language they repeat back** ("capital flow," "timing," "convergence")

Come back with patterns and I'll help you:
- Tune slide emphasis
- Refine objection handling
- Adjust valuation positioning
- Prepare for term sheet conversations

*This deck is fundable. The category is defensible. The magic moment is recordable. Now execute.*
