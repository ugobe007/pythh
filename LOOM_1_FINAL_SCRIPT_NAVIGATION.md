# Loom 1: Magic - Final Script (Navigation Edition)

**Duration**: 90 seconds  
**Goal**: "Holy sh*t, I can see the capital landscape."  
**Tone**: Calm, slow, curious. No hype, no selling.

---

## Opening (0:00-0:15) - The Reframe

**Say calmly**:

> "Fundraising usually feels like shouting into the void. What if you could see when investors are already discovering you — before anyone reaches out?"

**Action**: Paste AutoOps URL.

---

## Orientation Moment (0:15-0:35) - Addiction Begins

**Point to the Capital Navigation Triad and say**:

> "Before we show investors, this is the most important part. This shows where this startup is **positioned** relative to capital flows."

**[Pause for 1 second]**

**Point to observers count**:

> "Right now, 35 investors have shown discovery behavior around this startup in the last 7 days."

**[Pause for 2 seconds - CRITICAL]**

**Then**:

> "That means investors are already paying attention — even though the founder hasn't pitched anyone yet."

**Psychological moment**: This reframes the entire world.

---

## Momentum Moment (0:35-0:50) - Trust Lock

**Point to Flow badge (Breakout)**:

> "This startup just entered a breakout phase, which means investor attention is accelerating."

**Then immediately anchor it in evidence** (point to "Latest Signal"):

> "The latest signal happened four hours ago."

**Psychological moment**: "This is live."

---

## Investor Reveal (0:50-1:05) - Validation Moment

**Open Speedinvest investor card.**

**Read the evidence bullet slowly**:

> "Acceleration in discovery behavior — plus 4.3 signals in the last 24 hours."

**[Pause for 1 second]**

**Then say the line that changes fundraising forever**:

> "This investor hasn't contacted the founder yet. But behaviorally, they are already converging."

**Psychological moment**: "This feels like cheating."

---

## Hidden Pool (1:05-1:20) - Dopamine Trigger

**Scroll to blurred investor layer.**

**Say nothing for 1 second.**

**Then**:

> "Behind this paywall are 184 additional investors currently detecting this startup's signals."

**[Pause]**

**Then the line that makes founders NEED this**:

> "Most founders never know this is happening."

**Psychological moment**: Addiction.

---

## Coaching + Forecast (1:20-1:30) - Control Illusion

**Open one coaching card.**

**Read**:

> "If they publish technical benchmarks this week, our model shows a 12–18% increase in outreach probability."

**Psychological moment**: Agency, mastery, game dynamics.

---

## Closing (1:30-1:35) - Category Anchor

**Say calmly** (your perfect closer):

> "We don't match founders to investors — we detect when capital is already converging on them, and show founders how to amplify that signal."

**Stop recording.**

**No call to action. Let silence do the work.**

---

## Critical Delivery Notes

### Tone Rules
- **Calm**: Never excited, never salesy
- **Slow**: Especially during pauses
- **Curious**: Like showing a physics experiment

**The moment this feels "salesy," the magic dies.**

### Pause Rules
1. **After "35 investors"** → 2-second pause (CRITICAL)
2. **After "behaviorally converging"** → 1-second pause
3. **Before "184 hidden"** → 1-second silence
4. **After closer** → Stop immediately, no outro

### Recording Tips
- Don't re-record more than twice
- First authentic take is usually best
- If you mess up a word, keep going (authenticity > perfection)
- Use AutoOps as your demo (golden path verified)

## What This Script Achieves

### Psychological Arc
1. **Uncertainty**: "Am I ready to fundraise?"
2. **Orientation**: "35 investors watching right now"
3. **Validation**: "Speedinvest evidence, 4 hours ago"
4. **Anticipation**: "184 hidden investors"
5. **Control**: "Publish benchmarks → +12-18%"
6. **Reward**: "Capital is converging"

This is the 7-step addiction loop, compressed into 90 seconds.

### Why It Works
- Opens with founder anxiety (universal)
- Delivers orientation in first 20 seconds
- Proves it's live (4 hours ago)
- Creates FOMO (184 hidden)
- Gives control (coaching)
- Ends with category definition

### What Makes It Different
- No feature listing
- No "we built" language
- No call to action
- Just: **"This is the capital landscape. Here's your position in it."**

That's infrastructure thinking, not tool thinking.

## After Recording

### Distribution
1. Put at top of pitch deck (Slide 1)
2. Create "Pyth Demo Room" (Notion/Doc page with all 3 Looms)
3. Send to 5 accelerators (YC, Techstars, a16z START, EF, etc.)
4. No deck yet — just Loom

### What to Track
- **Reply rate**: % of recipients who respond
- **First question**: What they ask first
- **Language used**: Do they say "capital flow" / "trajectory"?
- **Next step requested**: Demo, meeting, or deck?

### Expected Reactions
- Technical founders: "Show me the SQL"
- Angels/ex-VCs: "This changes fundraising"
- Accelerators: "How do you get the data?"
- Skeptics: "Is this real-time?"

All of these are good signals. Come back with the reactions and I'll help you tune the pitch.

## The Moment You'll Know It Worked

When a founder or investor says:

> "I didn't know I could **see** capital flows like this."

That's when you know you've built infrastructure, not a tool.
