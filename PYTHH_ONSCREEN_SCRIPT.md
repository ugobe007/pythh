# PYTHH — ON-SCREEN COPY BLOCKS & REVEAL ORDER
## Frozen Implementation Script

**This translates the emotional arc into exact on-screen execution.**

## THE SINGLE PRODUCT TRUTH (FROZEN)

> Pythh is a cause–effect oracle that shows founders  
> who recognizes them now,  
> who will recognize them next,  
> and how to bend the future of capital toward them.

## THE 30-SECOND EXPERIENTIAL SCRIPT

### MOMENT 1: POWER (0–3 seconds)
**"This knows me."**

#### On-screen copy (exact):
```
We found 5 investors that match your signals.
50+ more are forming.
```

#### Visual hierarchy:
- **Dominant:** Number (5 investors)
- **Secondary:** Count (50+ more)
- **Zero:** Explanation, context, preamble

#### Component: IdentityHeader + Top5Readout (first 3)
#### Forbidden: Intro text, "Welcome", "Let's show you", onboarding

---

### MOMENT 2: CURIOSITY (3–8 seconds)
**"This is not random."**

#### On-screen copy (exact, per match):
```
US Seed Operator Fund                                72%
Why: Portfolio adjacency + operator bias
Align: Publish benchmark → triggers infra thesis
```

#### Visual hierarchy:
- **Dominant:** Investor name + score
- **Causal:** Why (1 line, human language)
- **Leverage:** Align (1 line, action → effect)

#### Component: Top5Readout (Why/Align lines)
#### Forbidden: "We analyzed", "Our algorithm found", "Based on", AI language

---

### MOMENT 3: WONDERMENT (8–12 seconds)
**"This is alive."**

#### On-screen copy (exact):
```
Beyond Your Top 5

17 investors are warming up to your category.
6 became newly aligned this week.
3 cooled off.
```

#### Visual hierarchy:
- **Temporal signals:** Warming/aligned/cooled counts
- **Blurred matches:** Names obscured, partial whys visible
- **Zero:** Static lists, full reveals

#### Component: DesireBlurList (counts section)
#### Forbidden: "Premium feature", "Upgrade to see", marketing CTAs

---

### MOMENT 4: AGENCY (12–18 seconds)
**"I can move this."**

#### On-screen copy (exact):
```
This Week

Publish technical benchmark
Why it moves capital: Triggers infrastructure pattern match across 8 portfolios

Add 1 named reference customer
Why it moves capital: Flips proof signal from inferred to explicit

Tighten narrative to infrastructure
Why it moves capital: Reduces category ambiguity (orthogonal → adjacent)
```

#### Visual hierarchy:
- **Action:** What to do (bold, left-aligned)
- **Causal:** Why it moves capital (not "why you should")
- **Zero:** Steps, instructions, coaching tone

#### Component: ThisWeekReadout
#### Forbidden: "You should", "We recommend", "Next steps", numbered lists

---

### MOMENT 5: OWNERSHIP (18–25 seconds)
**"This is mine."**

#### On-screen copy (exact):
```
How Capital Reads You

You're being read as infrastructure, not application.
Your proof is inferred, not explicit.
Your category is legible to operators, less legible to thesis funds.
Team signals are stronger than traction signals.
```

#### Visual hierarchy:
- **Plain statements:** 4–6 lines, no bullets
- **No numbers:** No scores, percentages, metrics
- **No advice:** Orientation, not judgment

#### Component: SignalMirror
#### Forbidden: "You need to", charts, readiness scores, emotional language

---

### MOMENT 6: ADDICTION (25–30 seconds)
**"If I change something… will this change?"**

#### On-screen copy (exact):
```
Beyond Your Top 5

More aligned: 23
More misaligned: 47
Warming: 12

[Blurred investor names with partial whys visible]

[Quiet unlock CTA]
```

#### Visual hierarchy:
- **Counts:** Change indicators (warming/cooling)
- **Blurred depth:** Names hidden, whys partially visible
- **Inevitable:** Not salesy, just... there

#### Component: DesireBlurList (full component)
#### Forbidden: "Unlock now!", "See who's interested!", hype language

## COPY TONE RULES (PER SECTION)

### Top 5 — Neutral, precise
- "Portfolio adjacency + operator bias"
- "Category convergence detected"
- **Not:** "We think", "AI found", "You should"

### This Week — Causal, actionable
- "Why it moves capital: [effect]"
- **Not:** "Why you should: [reason]"

### Signal Mirror — Observational, calm
- "You're being read as infrastructure"
- **Not:** "You need to position as", "You should change"

### Desire — Inevitable, quiet
- "Unlock your full investor map"
- **Not:** "See all matches now!", "Upgrade today!"

---

## FORBIDDEN PATTERNS (KILL ON SIGHT)

### Above the fold:
❌ "Welcome to Pythh"  
❌ "Here's how it works"  
❌ "Let us show you"  
❌ Onboarding copy  
❌ Product narration  
❌ Explanation before revelation  

### Anywhere:
❌ "AI-powered"  
❌ "Our algorithm"  
❌ "Based on analysis"  
❌ "We recommend"  
❌ "You should"  
❌ Readiness scores above diagnostics toggle  
❌ Marketing CTAs  

---

## THE ADDICTION TRIGGER (EXACT PLACEMENT)

**Where:** After SignalMirror, before final DesireBlurList

**Copy:**
```
[Blurred investor names]
[Warming/cooling counts]
[Partial whys visible]
```

**Brain completion:**
> "If I change something... will this change?"

**No text needed.** The visual alone must trigger the thought.

---

## IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

Before shipping any results page iteration:

- [ ] Does revelation come before explanation? (Power first)
- [ ] Are "Why" lines causal and human? (No AI language)
- [ ] Are "Align" lines leverage, not advice? (Action → Effect)
- [ ] Do temporal signals show movement? (Warming/cooling)
- [ ] Is the Signal Mirror judgment-free? (Orientation only)
- [ ] Are blurred matches partially visible? (Names hidden, whys not)
- [ ] Is the unlock CTA quiet? (Inevitable, not salesy)
- [ ] Are diagnostics hidden by default? (Toggle only)
- [ ] Does the bottom trigger "If I change..."? (Addiction loop)

---

## THE SINGLE IMPLEMENTATION TRUTH

> If a founder reaches the bottom and doesn't think  
> "If I change something... will this change?"  
> then the implementation is wrong.

That thought is the product.

Everything else is noise.
