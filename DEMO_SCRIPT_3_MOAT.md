# 🔄 LOOM 3: MOAT (60 seconds)

**Goal**: Show why this compounds and gets better over time.

## Script

### [0:00-0:15] Opening (The Moat Question)
**Visual**: Whiteboard/diagram tool or slides

> "Here's why this gets more valuable every day. It's not a static database — it's a compounding behavioral data engine."

### [0:15-0:35] The Flywheel Diagram
**Visual**: Draw or animate the flywheel

> "Every observer event makes the system smarter. When founders unlock their maps, we learn which investors actually convert. That feeds back into the forecasting model."

**Highlight each step** as you narrate

### [0:35-0:45] Network Effects (The Kicker)
**Visual**: Show growing numbers

> "Right now, 1,129 events. In 30 days? 50,000. In 90 days? 500,000. The more startups join, the more investor behavior we capture, the better the timing intelligence gets."

**Animate numbers growing**:
```
Day 0:   1,129 events
Day 30:  50,000 events  (+43x)
Day 90:  500,000 events (+443x)
```

### [0:45-0:55] Defensibility (Why You Can't Copy This)
**Visual**: Side-by-side comparison

| Traditional Matching | Pyth |
|---------------------|------|
| Static profiles | Live behavioral signals |
| Manual updates | Continuous scraping |
| No feedback loop | Events → Unlocks → Learning |
| Day 1 = Day 100 | Compounds exponentially |

> "Traditional platforms don't get smarter. We do. Every. Single. Day."

### [0:55-0:60] Closing Line
**Visual**: Cut to Pyth logo with tagline

> "Observer tracking compounds. Timing intelligence gets better every day. That's the moat."

**Text overlay**:
```
Compounding Data Moat
Not a feature. A category.

## Flywheel Breakdown (Detailed)

### Stage 1: Event Collection
- RSS scrapers find investor mentions → `news` events
- Portfolio scrapers track listings → `portfolio_overlap` events
- Forum monitors capture discussions → `forum` events
- Website diffs detect startup changes → `website_diff` signals

### Stage 2: Signal Generation
- Events aggregate into:
  - Observer counts (7d, 24h)
  - FOMO states (watch → warming → surge → breakout)
  - Phase-change scores (acceleration detection)
  - Portfolio adjacency (who invests in similar companies)

### Stage 3: Founder Attraction
- Better signals → More accurate convergence detection
- Founders see "35 observers watching" → Trust increases
- Word spreads: "It showed me investors I didn't know were watching"

### Stage 4: Unlock Conversion
- Founders unlock maps → See Speedinvest, a16z, etc.
- We learn: "Speedinvest outreach happened 9 days after we showed them"
- This feedback trains the forecast model (P(outreach in 14d))

### Stage 5: More Events
- Founders share their maps → More investors discover the platform
- Investors join Observatory → More explicit behavior tracking
- Two-sided flywheel: Founders generate demand, investors generate supply

## Why This Is Defensible

### 1. Data Moat (Primary)
- **Observer events compound**: 1,129 → 50K → 500K → 5M
- **Can't be copied**: Requires continuous scraping + founder trust
- **Gets better with scale**: More events → Better forecasts → More founders

### 2. Behavioral Physics (Secondary)
- Not keyword matching (easy to copy)
- Not profile database (commoditized)
- Physics-based acceleration detection (requires technical depth)

### 3. Explainability Layer (Tertiary)
- "Acceleration in discovery behavior (+4.3 signals/24h)"
- Founders trust specific evidence, not black boxes
- Trust → Unlocks → Learning → Better forecasts

### 4. Two-Sided Flywheel (Ultimate)
- Founders want timing intelligence → Join platform
- Investors want early access → Join Observatory
- Each side generates data for the other → Compounding

## Competitive Comparison

| Competitor | Moat Type | Why It Fails |
|------------|-----------|--------------|
| Crunchbase | Static profiles | No behavioral signals |
| AngelList | Directory | No timing detection |
| Warm intro networks | Social graphs | No scalability |
| Harmonic/Signal | Intent data | No founder-side product |
| LinkedIn Sales Nav | Profile search | No convergence physics |

**Pyth**: Behavioral data moat + two-sided platform + compounding effects

## Recording Tips

- **Visual**: Use Miro, Excalidraw, or Keynote for flywheel diagram
- **Animation**: Make the loop flow visually (arrows, highlights)
- **Pace**: Slow and deliberate — this is the "aha" moment
- **Energy**: Confident, almost understated ("This is just how physics works")
- **Close**: Strong, memorable ("Compounds every day")

## Investor Questions This Answers

**Q: "What if someone copies you?"**  
A: "They'd need 500,000 behavioral events and 2 years of founder trust. We're already compounding."

**Q: "What's your sustainable advantage?"**  
A: "Every observer event makes forecasts better. Every unlock teaches the model. It's a data moat, not a feature."

**Q: "Why can't Crunchbase do this?"**  
A: "They have profiles. We have behavioral physics. Profiles don't compound."

**Q: "How does this scale?"**  
A: "Two-sided flywheel: Founders generate demand, investors generate supply. Each side feeds the other."
