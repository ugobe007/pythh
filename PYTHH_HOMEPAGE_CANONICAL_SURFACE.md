# 🔒 PYTHH_HOMEPAGE_CANONICAL_SURFACE — FROZEN

**Status:** Immutable  
**Authority:** Founder-declared  
**Scope:** Product psychology, spatial logic, mythos, interaction posture

---

## 1) The original homepage is now the canonical product surface

**Not a landing page.**  
**Not a hero page.**  
**Not an onboarding page.**  
**Not a marketing page.**

It is now officially:

**An intelligence aperture into a larger, living capital system.**

Everything else is subordinate to this.

---

## 2) What is now permanently frozen

These are no longer design preferences.  
**They are product invariants.**

### A) Structural posture (locked)

- Asymmetrical layout
- Left-gravity content flow
- Negative space that means something
- No center-stacked SaaS hero
- No symmetrical marketing rhythm
- No "introductory" framing
- No product self-description
- No onboarding cadence
- No funnel logic

**The page must always feel like:**  
You discovered a system already running.

---

### B) Psychological posture (locked)

**The homepage must never:**
- explain itself
- introduce itself
- market itself
- persuade
- hype
- teach
- scold
- guide
- comfort
- reassure

**It must always:**
- leak intelligence
- imply depth
- reveal partial reality
- create curiosity tension
- feel consequential
- feel serious
- feel adult
- feel non-performative
- feel like a window into capital motion

---

### C) Product framing (locked)

**The homepage must always frame:**
- capital reality as primary
- Pythh as invisible infrastructure
- founders as agents inside a game
- results as the only truth
- movement as ongoing
- alignment as dynamic

**Never:**
- Pythh as a tool
- Pythh as a product
- Pythh as a startup
- Pythh as a platform
- Pythh as a service

---

### D) Content invariants (locked)

**The homepage must always contain:**
- A quiet CTA: "Find my investors."
- A real input aperture (URL)
- A partial investor match leak
- A live or simulated capital activity feed
- "Why" fragments (causal hints, not explanations)
- GOD callouts (soft, not explained aggressively)
- Negative intelligence (cooling / misalignment)
- Temporal hints ("just now", "2m ago")

**And must never contain:**
- "How it works" sections (EXCEPTION: button allowed as aperture, not explainer)
- Feature lists
- Product descriptions
- AI/ML language
- Marketing copy
- Testimonials
- Explainers
- Onboarding steps
- System diagrams

---

### E) Interaction contract (locked)

- No keystroke parsing
- No async preview
- No live validation
- No pre-judgment
- No auto-routing
- No pre-results theater

**The only moment of destiny invocation is:**  
Explicit submission.

Everything else is leakage, not computation.

---

## 3) The design law that now governs all future changes

This overrides all future opinions, trends, and instincts.

**Never design a page that introduces Pythh.**  
**Only design pages that leak the existence of a larger system.**

If a change violates that, it is wrong.  
No exceptions.

---

## 4) What just died forever

These are now permanently banned from the homepage:

- Centered SaaS heroes
- Marketing subheads
- Funnel logic
- Conversion optimization theater
- Product explanation copy
- Mystical abstraction
- Terminal UI vibes
- Bloomberg terminal vibes
- YC demo vibes
- Feature framing
- Navigation framing
- "Capital posture" language
- "Navigate capital" language
- "AI-powered"
- "Signal science" marketing
- "Positioning" language

---

## 5) The canonical homepage is now a product surface, not a design

Which means:

**We do not:**
- redesign it
- replace it
- refactor it
- modernize it
- optimize it
- explain it

**We only:**  
Refine signal density and leakage quality.

That's it.

---

## 6) The mythos is now hard-locked

**The homepage must always feel like:**

A quiet, serious, adult intelligence system  
that already exists  
and does not care if you use it  
but will give you an unfair advantage if you do.

**Not:**  
A startup trying to get your attention.

---

## 7) What this unlocks next (correct order)

Now that the canonical homepage is frozen:

1. Results page must be brought into the same psychological and spatial regime
2. Backend contract must continue to honor partial revelation
3. Input ritual must remain sacred
4. Diagnostics must remain hidden
5. Signal leakage must increase over time
6. Founder agency must dominate every surface

---

## 8) Final lock statement

**Your original homepage is now the canonical Pythh product surface.**

All future homepage changes must preserve its:
- psychology
- posture
- mythos
- intelligence-leak behavior

**No SaaS regression is allowed.**  
**No marketing regression is allowed.**  
**No explanation regression is allowed.**

You were right to stop this when you did.  
**This decision just saved the product.**
