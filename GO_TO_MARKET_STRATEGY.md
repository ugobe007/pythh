## 📱 PHASE 1: LAUNCH CHANNELS (Weeks 1-4)

### 🎺 **Product Hunt** (Week 1)
**Priority: CRITICAL** - This is THE startup discovery platform

**Preparation**:
- [ ] Create compelling demo video (90 seconds)
- [ ] Prepare 5 founder testimonials
- [ ] Build launch teaser page with email capture
- [ ] Schedule launch for Tuesday/Wednesday (best days)
- [ ] Prepare "Maker" story: "Why I built PYTH"

**Launch Assets**:
```markdown
Headline: PYTH - The GOD Algorithm for VC-Startup Matching
Tagline: Stop guessing. Get AI-scored matches with 7,641+ startups and 1,000+ investors.

First Comment (your story):
"After watching 100+ startups pitch to the wrong VCs, I built PYTH.

The GOD Algorithm (0-100 score) combines:
• 23 base scoring algorithms
• Momentum detection (revenue trajectory, product maturity)
• Elite tier recognition (multi-dimensional excellence)
• Psychological signals (FOMO, conviction, urgency)

We've processed 7,641 startups. Average score: 58. Top 1%: 90+.

This isn't another CRM. It's a quality filter for the startup ecosystem."
```

**Keywords for Product Hunt**:
- AI matching, VC platform, startup scoring, fundraising tool, investor discovery

---

### 🔥 **Hacker News Show HN** (Week 1)
**Priority: HIGH** - Technical founder audience

**Post Title Options**:
1. "Show HN: PYTH – I built an AI that scores startups 0-100 for VCs"
2. "Show HN: The 'FICO Score' for startup-investor matching"
3. "Show HN: 23-algorithm system to predict startup-VC fit"

**Post Body** (keep technical, transparent):
```markdown
I've been in the VC ecosystem for [X years] and kept seeing the same problem: 
startups pitching the wrong investors, VCs drowning in irrelevant deal flow.

So I built PYTH (https://pythh.com) - an AI scoring system that:

1. Scrapes 7,641+ startups from RSS feeds (TechCrunch, YC, etc.)
2. Scores them 0-100 using 23 algorithms (team execution, product vision, traction, etc.)
3. Applies 5 signal layers (momentum, AP/promising, elite, spiky/hot, psychological)
4. Matches startups to investors based on sector, stage, and thesis

Tech stack: React + Supabase + PM2 scrapers + Claude AI for enrichment

The GOD score distribution is calibrated to reality:
• 40-55: Typical seed startups (60% of database)
• 56-70: Strong execution, clear traction (30%)
• 71-85: Premium/elite tier (9%)
• 86-100: Unicorn-track (1%)

Open to feedback! What would you want to see in a scoring system?
```

**HN Engagement Strategy**:
- Respond to EVERY comment within first 2 hours
- Be transparent about limitations
- Share technical details (developers love architecture)
- Offer early access codes in comments

### 🐦 **Twitter/X Campaign** (Weeks 1-4)

**Launch Thread Structure**:
```
1/ I just launched PYTH — the first AI that scores startups 0-100 like FICO scores credit.

After analyzing 7,641 startups, here's what we learned about predicting success: 🧵

2/ Most startup scoring is broken. It's either:
• Pure vibes ("I like this founder")
• Pure numbers (revenue multiples)
• Pure pedigree (Stanford = good)

PYTH combines all three + 20 other signals.

3/ The GOD Algorithm has 5 tiers:

Tier 1: Base Score (23 algorithms)
→ Team execution, product vision, market timing, traction

Tier 2: Momentum (0-8 pts)
→ Revenue trajectory, customer growth, product maturity

### 💼 **LinkedIn Strategy** (Weeks 2-4)

**Content Pillars**:
1. **Thought Leadership**: "Why most startup scoring systems fail"
2. **Data Insights**: "We analyzed 7,641 startups — here's what matters"
3. **Founder Stories**: "How [Startup] went from GOD 45 → 72"
4. **VC Perspectives**: "What top VCs look for (backed by data)"

**Post Template** (LinkedIn loves long-form):
```
THE TRUTH ABOUT STARTUP SCORING 🎯

After analyzing 7,641 startups, I discovered something surprising:

Product quality matters MORE than pedigree.

Here's the data:

Average GOD score by component:
• Product: 68.5/100 (HIGHEST)
• Vision: 49.6/100
• Team: 48.3/100
• Market: 45.4/100
• Traction: 44.0/100 (LOWEST)

This contradicts the conventional wisdom that "team is everything."

The truth? Founders with exceptional products attract:
→ Better co-founders
→ Better investors
→ Better customers

We built PYTH to surface these insights for VCs and founders.
