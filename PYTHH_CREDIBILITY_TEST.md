# PYTHH FOUNDER CREDIBILITY TEST

**Duration:** 10 minutes  
**Frequency:** After every significant change  
**Pass condition:** "This system is stricter than I am — and that's good."

---

## The Setup

Pick one real startup you know well. Ideally:
- Seed or Series A
- Not famous
- Actively fundraising or about to

**Pretend you are that founder.**

---

## Test 1 — Trends Gut Check (2 minutes)

Land on `/trends`.

Ask yourself:
- [ ] Do I immediately look for my sector?
- [ ] Do I switch VC lenses instinctively?
- [ ] Do I notice rank movement without trying?
- [ ] Do I feel early, late, or unsure?

**If you do not feel tension here, Trends is underpowered.**

---

## Test 2 — Signals Trust Check (3 minutes)

Click into `/signals` for your startup.

Ask:
- [ ] Does this explain why I feel early/late?
- [ ] Does timing feel computed or editorial?
- [ ] Do I trust this more than Twitter noise?

**If you start questioning methodology here, fix Signals before anything else.**

---

## Test 3 — Matches Discipline Check (3 minutes)

Go to `/matches`.

Ask:
- [ ] Do I immediately know who to ignore?
- [ ] Do I feel prevented from wasting time?
- [ ] Am I discouraged from premature outreach?

**If Matches feels like a lead list, it has failed.**

---

## Test 4 — Investor Decision Check (2 minutes)

Open `/investor/:id`.

Ask:
- [ ] Do I understand why now or why not now?
- [ ] Would I wait if the page tells me to wait?
- [ ] Would I defend this logic to a co-founder?

**If the page can't stop you from making a bad decision, it's not credible.**

---

## Pass Condition

You pass if the founder feels:

> "This system is stricter than I am — and that's good."

Anything less = erosion risk.

---

## Common Failure Points

| Test | Weak Spot | Fix |
|------|-----------|-----|
| Trends | No tension | Make rank movement more visible |
| Signals | Feels editorial | Show computed basis, not prose |
| Matches | Feels like leads | Remove outreach affordances |
| Investor | Can't stop bad decisions | Strengthen timing warnings |

---

## When to Run This Test

- After any UI change to a canonical surface
- Before any deploy that touches scoring logic
- When in doubt

**If it still stops bad decisions, we ship.**
