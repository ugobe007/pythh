## 🎯 DECISION POINTS

**You need to decide**:

1. **Launch Date**: Recommend **Tuesday, February 25, 2026**
   - Tuesday/Wednesday are best for Product Hunt
   - Gives 1 week to prep
   - Recalculation will be complete

2. **Monetization**: Start charging immediately or freemium?
   - **Option A**: Free for everyone, monetize later (maximize growth)
   - **Option B**: Charge VCs $299/month from day 1 (validate willingness to pay)
   - **Recommendation**: Freemium (free tier + paid features)

3. **API**: Build API Week 1 or post-launch?

   - **Option B**: Launch platform first, API in Week 3-4
   - **Recommendation**: Platform first, API Week 3

4. **Positioning**: "FICO for Startups" or "AI Matching Platform"?
