# PYTHH RESULTS PAGE — VISUAL LANGUAGE CONTRACT v1.0

**What /results must feel like:** A capital desk readout.

**Not:** A report. Not a dashboard. Not a product tour.

---

## CORE AESTHETIC PHYSICS

- **Left-weighted hierarchy** (discovery gravity)
- **Across-the-page flow** (wide, not portrait)
- **Thin dividers, restrained boxes**
- **One accent color max** (use sparingly)
- **No card grids** as the primary structure
- **No "feature UI"** (tabs, pills, widgets) above the fold

---

## THE PAGE MUST ANSWER (VISUALLY) IN 5 SECONDS

1. **Who are my Top 5 matches?** (dominant, immediate)
2. **What's the signal score for each investor?** (right-aligned, legible)
3. **Why are we aligned?** (1-line causal reason per match)
4. **How do I align more?** (one leverage action per match)
5. **What's next?** (3 actions, not a lecture)

Everything else is subordinate.

## SPATIAL LAYOUT CONTRACT

### "Leaking Map – Results Edition" (wide, left-weighted)

**Above the fold must be this shape:**

### Rules:
- **Top 5 is not in cards**
- It is a **ranked readout** (line-based, terminal-like)
- **Score is right-aligned** so the eye can scan
- Each match has exactly:
  - **Why:** 1 line
  - **Align:** 1 line
- **CTA is quiet**, not "salesy"
- **No diagnostics, no readiness lecture, no promotional blocks above fold**

---

## SECTION CONTRACTS (IN ORDER)

### Section 0 — Identity Header (thin, calm)

**Must include:**
- Startup name + domain
- One posture label (Forming / Prime / Cooling) — neutral tone
- Confidence (Low/Med/High)

**Must NOT include:**
- Giant hero numbers
- Flashy gradients
- Product slogans
- "AI-powered"

**This is a "you are here" coordinate, not marketing.**

---

### Section 1 — Top 5 Matches (dominant)

**Must be:**
- Ranked list readout (not a grid)
- One investor per row block
- Minimal ornamentation
- High scan-ability

**Must show per investor:**
- Investor name
- Score
- Distance tag (warm/adjacent/cold) – subtle
- **Why** (1 line)
- **Align** (1 line)
- Expand affordance: "details" (small)

**Expand shows (still restrained):**
- 3 bullets "causal reasons"
- 3 bullets "leverage actions"
- No charts, no dashboards

---

### Section 2 — Misalignment (honesty block)

**This is where trust becomes belief.**

**Shape:**
- Same readout style, cooler tone
- Not hidden, not gated

**Show:**
- 3–8 misaligned investors
- Why-not line
- Missing signal list (short)

**Rule:**
- Never shame
- Never "too early"
- Never "not ready"
- Just "currently orthogonal because…"

---

### Section 3 — Signal Mirror (orientation)

**This must look like a "mirror," not a report.**

**Format:**
- 4–6 plain statements
- No numbers
- No advice tone
- No charts

**Example style:**
- "You're being read as infrastructure, not application."
- "Your proof is inferred, not explicit."
- "Your category is legible to operators, less legible to thesis funds."

---

### Section 4 — This Week (leverage actions)

**Three actions, each with one reason.**

No coaching lecture.

**Format:**
- 3 rows, not 3 cards
- Each row: **Action** + "Why it moves capital"

---

### Section 5 — Desire (blurred matches)

**This is where gating belongs.**

**Rules:**
- Blur names only, never blur "why_partial"
- Show counts (more aligned / more misaligned / warming)
- Keep it quiet and inevitable, not salesy

---

### Section 6 — Diagnostics (hidden)

**Only behind a toggle.**

Never visible by default.

---

## VISUAL "DON'TS"

These are the regressions that made it feel bad before:

❌ **Card grids as the primary layout**  
❌ **Centered hero stacks**  
❌ **Big rounded inputs/buttons on results page**  
❌ **Dashboard widgets** (charts, gauges) above fold  
❌ **"How it works" anywhere on /results**  
❌ **Marketing copy, slogans, product narration**  
❌ **Emotional scolding or praise**  
❌ **Diagnostics creeping up into the product surface**

---

## MICROCOPY LOCK (TONE)

**Neutral, precise, calm**

- "Why" and "Align" must be **causal and actionable**
- Never "you should/must"
- Never "AI thinks"
- Never "readiness" lecture language

---

## THE SINGLE TRUTH STATEMENT FOR /RESULTS

> **/results is a ranked capital readout with causal whys and leverage—nothing else.**
