## Script

### [0:00-0:10] Opening Hook
**Visual**: Screen recording, cursor ready at URL bar

> "Let me show you something different. This isn't a database of investors. It's a capital convergence detector."

**Action**: Paste `https://autoops.com` into input

---

### [0:10-0:25] Status Bar Reveal (The "Whoa" Moment)
**Visual**: Status bar animates in with real numbers

> "35 investors are actively discovering AutoOps right now. Not 'might be interested' — actually watching."

**Highlight**:
- **35 observers** (real count, not estimated)
- **Breakout state** (not hype, physics)
- **Fast feedback velocity** (signal strength 8.6/10)

**Pause for 3 seconds** - let it sink in

---

### [0:25-0:45] Top 5 Investors (Evidence, Not Matching)
**Visual**: Scroll through visible investor cards slowly

> "Look at Speedinvest. We're not guessing they're a fit. We detected acceleration in their discovery behavior — 4.3 signals in the last 24 hours."

**Click on Speedinvest card** - expand to show full details

**Read evidence bullets**:
- "Acceleration in discovery behavior (+4.3 signals 24h)"
- "Portfolio adjacency detected (72%)"
- "Invests in Seed, Series A stage companies"

> "Every bullet point is backed by timestamped behavioral events. This is physics, not profiles."

---

### [0:45-0:60] The Hidden Pool (FOMO Trigger)
**Visual**: Scroll to blurred investor section

> "There are 184 more investors in your convergence pool. You can't see them yet — but they're real, they're watching, and we're tracking their behavior."

**Highlight**: "Unlock full map" button

> "This is where founders realize: the fundraising game isn't random. It's about timing."

---

### [0:60-0:75] Coaching Tied to Action
**Visual**: Scroll to coaching panel

> "Here's what moves the needle: publish technical proof — benchmarks, API docs. Our model says that could increase your outreach probability by 9 to 15 percent in the next 14 days."

**Highlight**: "+9-15% outreach likelihood" tag

> "This isn't advice. It's a lever."

---

### [0:75-0:90] Closing Line
**Visual**: Zoom out to show full page, then cut to black with text overlay

> "This isn't matching. It's capital convergence detection. And it gets smarter every day."

**Text overlay**:
```

- **Cursor**: Highlight numbers by hovering/circling
- **Energy**: Confident but not salesy
- **Silence**: Let the data breathe (3-second pause at 0:25)
- **Close**: Strong, memorable one-liner
